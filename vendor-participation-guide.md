Perfect ‚úÖ you‚Äôre essentially asking: *‚ÄúWhat is my full scope of preparation as a vendor/developer for the National DRG System?‚Äù*

I‚Äôll prepare a **comprehensive structured document** that you can use as your **work checklist & tender preparation guide**.

# üìÑ Vendor Preparation Guide ‚Äì National DRG System (Malaysia)

## 1. üìå Project Understanding

* **Objective:** Upgrade MyCMX ‚Üí National DRG System on MyGovCloud.
* **Purpose:** Standardise DRG grouping (inpatient, outpatient, daycare) with tariff assignment, ensure fair hospital funding, and integrate with SMRP & MyGDX.
* **Stakeholders:**

  * KKM (Admin, Finance, Analysts)
  * Hospitals (Doctors, Coders, Finance, Management)
  * Insurers/Panel companies (indirect beneficiaries)

## 2. üìä Key Responsibilities (Vendor Scope)

You are responsible for **building and delivering the system** ‚Äî not for customizing every hospital‚Äôs HIS.

### ‚úÖ Must Deliver

1. **System Architecture & Infrastructure**

   * Design cloud-based microservices on **MyGovCloud@CFA**.
   * High-availability, secure, scalable design.
   * Support APIs + SFTP for data exchange.

2. **Core DRG Engine**

   * Implement or upgrade **DRG grouping algorithms**.
   * Support **Inpatient, Outpatient, Daycare DRGs**.
   * Automate **tariff calculation logic** (cost weight √ó base rate).

3. **Integration Capability**

   * Provide **API specifications & documentation**.
   * Support **data exchange with HIS** (hospital side).
   * Enable integration with **SMRP** and **MyGDX** (KKM national systems).

4. **Security & Compliance**

   * Authentication & role-based access (Hospitals vs KKM).
   * Encryption of data in transit & at rest.
   * Logging, audit trails, and compliance with government IT standards.

5. **User Interfaces**

   * **Hospital Portal:** Upload case files, view DRG results, check tariffs, track claims.
   * **KKM Dashboard:** National analytics, funding allocation, cost monitoring.

6. **Data Management**

   * Migration of existing MyCMX data.
   * Database schema for DRG records, tariffs, case mix indexes.
   * ETL pipelines for SMRP / HIS integration.

7. **Support & Documentation**

   * Provide **API manuals, training materials, and user guides**.
   * Establish a **Helpdesk process** for hospitals during rollout.
   * Conduct **training sessions** for KKM users.

---

## 3. üéØ What Hospitals Will Do (Not Your Scope)

* Map their HIS data ‚Üí your DRG API.
* Send case data to your system (ICD, procedures, length of stay).
* Consume your DRG outputs (tariff, code) for their finance & claims.

---

## 4. üì° Integrations to Prepare

* **HIS (Hospital Information Systems):** via API/SFTP.
* **SMRP (Sistem Maklumat Rawatan Pesakit):** patient case data.
* **MyGDX (MyGov Data Exchange):** inter-agency data exchange.

---

## 5. üìë Deliverables to Prepare

1. **Technical Deliverables**

   * Architecture diagrams.
   * API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger preferred).
   * Data mapping templates (ICD, procedure, DRG code schema).
   * DRG tariff calculation formula documentation.

2. **Project Deliverables**

   * Project plan (timeline, milestones, deployment phases).
   * Risk assessment & mitigation plan.
   * Training & knowledge transfer plan.
   * System acceptance testing (UAT, security testing).

3. **Compliance Deliverables**

   * Cloud compliance with MyGovCloud policies.
   * Security certifications (ISO/ISMS if applicable).
   * Backup & disaster recovery plan.

## 6. üìä RACI Responsibility Matrix (Summary)

| Task                                       | Vendor | Hospital | KKM   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Build DRG system (engine, UI, APIs)        | **R**  | I        | A     |
| Provide API documentation                  | **R**  | C        | A     |
| Integrate HIS with DRG system              | C      | **R**    | A     |
| Upload case data                           | I      | **R**    | A     |
| Run DRG grouping + tariff calculation      | **R**  | I        | A     |
| National monitoring / funding allocation   | I      | I        | **R** |
| Analytics & reporting                      | C      | I        | **R** |
| Security & compliance with govt. standards | **R**  | I        | A     |

**R = Responsible | A = Accountable | C = Consulted | I = Informed**

## 7. üöÄ Immediate Next Steps (What You Should Prepare Now)

1. Draft **high-level system architecture** (cloud + DRG engine + APIs).
2. Prepare **API schema draft** (JSON/XML, HL7 FHIR optional).
3. Draft **tariff calculation logic** proposal.
4. Prepare **integration workflow diagrams** (HIS ‚Üí DRG ‚Üí SMRP/MyGDX ‚Üí KKM).
5. List **security controls** (auth, encryption, audit logs).
6. Build a **prototype/demo portal** for DRG case upload + tariff return.
7. Collect compliance documentation (cloud certification, DR plan, support model).

---

‚úÖ With this, you‚Äôll have a **comprehensive preparation document** to guide your work and respond to KKM expectations.

Would you like me to generate this into a **professional PPTX deck** (with diagrams + checklists) so you can use it directly for tender briefing and internal planning?
