Excellent question üëå ‚Äî those are critical to show in your tender response because KKM explicitly wants a **cloud-native, microservices, high-availability design** (vs. the old monolith MyCMX).

Here‚Äôs how **Load Balancer + Kubernetes (K8s)** fit into the recommended architecture:

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer (LB)

* **Role:** Entry point for all hospital HIS/API calls, KKM dashboards, and SFTP file transfers.
* **Options on MyGovCloud@CFA:**

  * Native **Cloud Load Balancer** (if CFA offers one), or
  * HAProxy / NGINX Ingress Controller on K8s.
* **Features required:**

  * **SSL termination** (TLS 1.2/1.3).
  * **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** (OWASP CRS) for threat filtering.
  * **Rate limiting + throttling** to prevent overload from hospitals.
  * **Routing rules** (API traffic vs. UI vs. SFTP).

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes (K8s)

* **Why:** The tender requires moving away from monolithic ‚Üí **microservices with high availability**.
* **Cluster setup on MyGovCloud@CFA:**

  * **Production:** 3+ master nodes, autoscaled worker nodes across zones.
  * **Staging/UAT:** smaller, mirrored cluster.
* **Components inside K8s:**

  * API services (FastAPI/Spring Boot).
  * DRG engine pods (stateless microservices).
  * Tariff engine pods.
  * Kafka/ZooKeeper (for ingestion).
  * Postgres/ClickHouse (or use CFA managed DB if available).
* **Deployment model:** GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) + CI/CD (GitLab/GitHub Actions).
* **Resilience:** Rolling updates, pod autoscaling (HPA), service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for observability + security.

## üîÄ How LB + K8s work together

1. **Hospital HIS / SFTP** ‚Üí enters via **Load Balancer**.
2. LB ‚Üí routes traffic to **K8s Ingress Controller**.
3. Ingress ‚Üí routes to correct microservice (DRG Engine, Tariff Engine, Case Intake, etc.).
4. K8s manages **scaling, failover, health checks** for services.
5. LB also balances traffic between **multiple K8s clusters** (if multi-region CFA deployment is mandated).

---

## üìå Benefits (aligned to tender needs)

* **High availability** ‚Üí no single point of failure.
* **Elastic scaling** ‚Üí handle peak submissions (e.g. month-end hospital claims).
* **Security & compliance** ‚Üí WAF + mTLS on LB, namespace isolation on K8s.
* **Future proof** ‚Üí easy to add new services (AI-based coding, analytics).

---

‚úÖ In short:

* **Load Balancer** = secure front door (routing + WAF).
* **Kubernetes** = resilient engine room (running microservices).
  Both are **explicitly expected** in the tender because of the ‚Äúmicroservices, scalable, high availability on MyGovCloud‚Äù requirement.

Would you like me to **draw you a C4 Container Diagram** (showing Load Balancer + K8s + databases + SMRP/MyGDX integrations) so you can include it in your proposal?
